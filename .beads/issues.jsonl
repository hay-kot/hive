Please add notes with examples or preferences.","notes":"## Research Findings\n\n### How Popular TUIs Handle Focus Indication\n\n#### 1. Lazygit / Lazydocker\n- **Bright blue border** around the focused pane (lazygotest confirms: 'highlighted with a bright blue border')\n- **Highlighted/brighter text** for active items\n- Very consistent visual language across all panels\n- Navigation: Tab to cycle, h/l or arrows to switch panes, number keys (1-5) for direct access\n\n#### 2. K9s (Kubernetes TUI)\n- Uses **configurable focus colors** via skins\n- Key styling properties: `focusColor`, `cursorColor`, `highlightColor`\n- Border has separate `fgColor` and `focusColor` \n- Allows full theme customization\n\n#### 3. btop/htop\n- **Color-coded sections** with distinct visual hierarchy\n- **Highlighted keys** are clickable/interactive\n- Relies more on section differentiation than active/inactive states\n- Uses ASCII art and Unicode for visual clarity\n\n#### 4. Tmux (Reference Pattern)\n- **Colorizes separators/dividers** adjacent to active pane\n- Inactive panes can be 'slightly greyed'\n- Active pane border set to distinct color (commonly blue)\n- Windows Terminal adopted similar approach\n\n### Bubble Tea / Lip Gloss Patterns\n\n#### Built-in Focus Support\n- `EnableReportFocus` for terminal focus events\n- Bubbles library has `Style struct` with focused/unfocused states\n- Common pattern: conditional style application based on focus state\n\n#### Border Options Available\n- `lipgloss.NormalBorder()` - standard\n- `lipgloss.ThickBorder()` - heavier weight\n- `lipgloss.DoubleBorder()` - double-line\n- `lipgloss.HiddenBorder()` - invisible (useful for unfocused to maintain alignment)\n- `BorderForeground()` to colorize\n\n### Design Options to Consider\n\nBased on research, here are the most viable approaches:\n\n#### Option A: Colored Divider (tmux-style)\nChange the vertical divider color based on which pane is focused:\n- Left focused: divider colored on right side or entire divider blue\n- Right focused: divider colored on left side\n- Subtle but effective in terminals\n\n#### Option B: Border Accent (lazygit-style)\nAdd a border to the focused pane only:\n- Focused: visible border (blue/accent color)\n- Unfocused: hidden border (maintains spacing)\n- Clear visual distinction\n\n#### Option C: Title Underline\nUnderline the focused pane title:\n- Less intrusive than borders\n- Clear indication of which pane\n- Works well with existing arrow indicator\n\n#### Option D: Dimmed Unfocused Pane\nDim/grey out the unfocused pane content:\n- Focused: normal colors\n- Unfocused: faded/dimmed colors\n- Common in IDEs (inactive panels)\n\n#### Option E: Selected Item Differentiation\nOnly show selection indicator in focused pane:\n- Active pane: blue bar on selected item\n- Inactive pane: no selection bar shown\n- User sees which pane can receive input\n\n### Recommendation\n\n**Option A (Colored Divider)** is the most elegant solution:\n1. Minimal visual clutter\n2. Proven pattern (tmux, Windows Terminal)\n3. Easy to implement with lipgloss\n4. Works with existing arrow + bold title indicators\n\nImplementation would be:\n```go\n// In renderSplitView\nvar dividerColor lipgloss.Color\nif m.focusedPane == PaneSessions {\n    dividerColor = colorBlue  // Blue when left focused (divider 'points' right)\n} else {\n    dividerColor = colorBlue  // Blue when right focused\n}\ndivider := lipgloss.NewStyle().\n    Foreground(dividerColor).\n    Render(strings.Repeat(\"│\", contentHeight))\n```\n\nOr **Option E** could complement this - only showing the selection bar (┃) in the focused pane.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"64056131+hay-kot@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-30T14:35:02.81949-06:00","created_by":"Hayden","updated_at":"2026-01-30T14:39:10.487747-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-30T14:39:10.487747-06:00","close_reason":"Research complete.
